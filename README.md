# jobsites
#indeedattempt1 was my first attempt to get the browsers to open up. Initially I attempted to get ziprecruiters API to work..
#however that turned out to be mostly for Employers looking for candidates. I am sure if I spent enough time with it I would have figured it out,
#but I was more interested in learning more about loops, string building and manipulation, and then building a GUI.
#this project was mostly to help me learn those concepts while being something I am invested in because part of my part-time job is looking through jobsites.
